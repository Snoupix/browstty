# Browstty

This project is my playground to try to implement [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) as a WASM module in the browser (browser + ghostty = browstty).

I've already made a simple [Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) that uses my Zig WASM module to proccess the Cells buffers.
